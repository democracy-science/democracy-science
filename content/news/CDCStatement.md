A joint statement made by the CDC and HHS released plans to recommend booster shots to the American population. They begin by stating that effectiveness in vaccines overtime is a common occurence and praise the COVID vaccine for its effectiveness in "reducing risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death." As the Delta variant began to spread, evidence began to circulate showing the vaccine was less effective, prompting a recommendation of booster shots, particularly for at risk populations or those who were vaccinated early on. They announce that the FDA will conduct a study on the safety and effectiveness of a third dose, and that they will review the data on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to make a recommendation later on. They finish with an emphasis on getting the vaccine in general, expressing concern over the fact that "nearly all the cases of severe disease, hospitalization, and death continue to occur among those not yet vaccinated at all."
