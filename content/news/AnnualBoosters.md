This article unearths several areas of the booster debate. For example, Israel has been pushing boosters as they claimed the decline of infection rates was due to this. However, COVID rates were falling in other countries, like the US, that had not begun widely offering boosters, questioning whether or not a booster would actually help. Proponents argue that "'To prevent serious illness, all you really need is immunological memory. If you look at COVID vaccines, that is holding up,'” and that booster doses for other vaccines are common. Still, concerns about vaccine efficacy (whether fair or unfair), the rise of new variants, and the imperfection of science all created resistence for the necessity of a booster shot.
