Though the panel recommended a booster for those in high risk groups and the elderly, the FDA did not recommend boosters for the general population over concerns of insufficient data and disagreements of the effectiveness of the initial doses. The panel felt that the effects from the first doses of the vaccine were not waning, and still provided a great deal of protection from severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Here, we can also see a push to remove politics from the discussion, saying "with the Biden administration having already publicly backed a third dose for all vaccinated Americans in August, the committee was tasked with separating the politics from the data to weigh in on whether the benefits of a booster shot outweighed the risks to an already-hesitant American public."
