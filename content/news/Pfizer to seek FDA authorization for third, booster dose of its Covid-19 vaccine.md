"Pfizer is about to seek U.S. authorization for a third dose of its Covid-19 vaccine, saying Thursday that another shot within 12 months could dramatically boost immunity and maybe help ward off the latest worrisome coronavirus mutant." 
"Antibodies naturally wane over time, so studies also are underway to tell if and when boosters might be needed."
"On Thursday, Pfizer’s Mikael Dolsten told the Associated Press that early data from the company’s booster study suggests people’s antibody levels jump five- to 10-fold after a third dose, compared to their second dose months earlier."
"In August, Pfizer plans to ask the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of a third dose, he said."
