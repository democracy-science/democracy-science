### FDA Authorizes Booster Dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine for Certain Populations

Today’s action demonstrates that science and the currently available data continue to guide the FDA’s decision-making for COVID-19 vaccines during this pandemic. 
After considering the totality of the available scientific evidence and the deliberations of our advisory committee of independent, external experts, 
the FDA amended the EUA for the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to allow for a booster dose in certain populations such as health care workers, teachers and day care staff, grocery workers 
and those in homeless shelters or prisons, among others, said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, M.D.
