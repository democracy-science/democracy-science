The CDC announced that a booster shot at 6 months or more after their initial series of a Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine eligible to be received by those 65 and older as well as those 18 and older who live in long-term care settings, have underlying medical conditions, or work or live in high-risk settings. Booster shots for the J&J vaccine are also recommended for those who are 18 and older and who were vaccinated two or more months ago. Eligible individuals may choose which vaccine they receive as a booster dose as CDCâ€™s recommendations now allow for this type of mix and match dosing for booster shots.
