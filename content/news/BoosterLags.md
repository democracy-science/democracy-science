One reason that Americans are not getting booster shots has to do with issues concerning the timing of their first two doses. Some people who are enthusiastic about booster shots have been unable to since the CDC recommends people get boosters 5 months after their second shot. It is also difficult from a convenience perspective, particularly for Black and Hispanic populations, since getting the shot requires the cost of time. The good news here is that more people will get their boosters, they just haven't been able to yet. Sadly, the less optimistic side of the coin reflects the media echochambers Americans are living in. The article says, "40 percent of vaccinated but not boosted Americans say that they will not get another dose under any circumstances or would do so only if it’s required." The reasoning has a lot to do wiith a lack of confidence in the vaccines and their government, as stories of breakthrough cases began to spread and the government has not led the people with a decisive, synchronized plan.
