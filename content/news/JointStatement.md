"In a press release, the CDC and FDA reinforced the importance of getting fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and the risk of not doing so, stating that almost all COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated. The press release stated that"Americans who have been fully vaccinated do not need a booster shot at the time of release. Additionally, the release states that the FDA, CDC, and NIH are engaging in a science-based process to determine whether or when a booster might be necessary and are prepared for booster doses if and when the science demonstrates that they are needed."
