summary = "When the booster shot was released to the public, the government urged people to take it, especially state governments that acted before federal officials to allow it to all adults.

"And about a dozen states didn’t wait for federal officials to act before opening boosters to all adults. 'The direction is not a good one. People are 
going inside more and, ‘oops,’ next week happens to be the largest travel week of the year, so it probably makes sense to do whatever we can here to try to 
turn the tide,' Marks told the AP."
