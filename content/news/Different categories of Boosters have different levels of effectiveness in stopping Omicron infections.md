title = "Most World's Vaccine Likely Won't Prevent Infection From Omicron"

date = 2021-12-21

Summary = "preliminary research suggests that only the Pfizer and Moderna shots, when reinforced by a booster
appear to have success at stopping Omicron infections, while other categories of vaccines, including Sinopharm and Sinovac
which make up almost half of all shots delivered globally, offer almost zero protection for the new virant. Experts begin
to worry about the ability of protection from Omicron in low-and middle-income countries, where there are limited access
to effective booster shots and the governments' focus is still on delivering first shots"
