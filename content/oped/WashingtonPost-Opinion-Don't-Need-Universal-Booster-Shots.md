date = 2021-11-29 
summary = Although we see a push for boosters, the only people it really benefits are those that are high-risk, however, it is not a preventative against Delta, according to studies done. Current vaccines will do their part in preventing severe disease caused by the omicron variant, however, the booster will likely not be helpful in dealing with resistance against the variant. And these shots can be better used to help the unvaccinated.

"The only way we can defeat this virus is by targeting the unvaccinated and getting them vaccinated rather than focusing our attention on the booster shots. This process of boosting is counterproductive because it delays vaccination in other countries and doesn't do much clinically. Boosters will do something, but trying to get everyone boosted should not be our main course of actiom right now."
