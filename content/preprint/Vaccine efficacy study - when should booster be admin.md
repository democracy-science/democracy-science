A vaccine efficacy study was conducted in Turkey to understand how long the humoral immune response induced by the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine persists. The study included 272 health workers who were vaccinated at days 0 and 28 by the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine and antibody concentrations were examined. Participants who had COVID-19 at a mean of 181 (90-330) days before the vaccination presented with a more stable antibody level than participants who did not. Overall, antibody concentrations at the 1st and 3rd months after vaccination with two doses of the inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine were found to be decreased, but still detectable. Researchers concluded with a recommendation of a booster at 6-12 months to maintain protective antibody response.
