Findings from the KFF COVID-19 Vaccine Monitor show that just over half of U.S. adults have received a booster (16%) or are likely to get one (37%). One in five are either fully vaccinated but unlikely to get a booster (12%) or only partially vaccinated (6%), and one-quarter still have not gotten a first shot, including 14% who say they will “definitely not” get vaccinated. Three in four Democrats have already received a booster or are likely to get one compared to about half of independents and just over a third of Republicans. 76% of fully vaccinated Democrats have gotten or are likely to get booster, meanwhile this statistic is 47% in Independents and 36% in Republicans.
