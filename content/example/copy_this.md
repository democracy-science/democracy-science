To navigate the site, click on the title "Booster Timeline" to go to the home page that lists all items. 

Click on a specific item to learn more about it. 

### Creating a File Like This One 
This item will show you how to format what you write. Look at this item from the Github site and compare with how it looks on the website. 

A new line creates a new paragraph. **Double Asterix** formats text as bold. *Single Asterix* formats with italics. 

Here is how you show a web link: [Link to preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v3)

If you look at the underlying text file (or markdown file, the one that ends with the extension ".md") you will see that text in square brackets becomes the underlined text that the reader sees. In the markdown file, this is followed immediately by a url that is enclosed in parentheses. 

# A Heading at Level 1

Use one or more '#' characters to insert a heading. See above, a heading with just one '#'. It is too big! Notice that right now, the headings create a table of contents in the left margin. If the pages are short, it might be best to turn this off. 
 
## A Heading at Level 2 

Next, see one that uses 2 of the '#' symbols.  

### A Heading at Level 3 

This might be more appropriate. 
 
### Meta Data 

At the top of the page, you supply meta data that describes this page. It should look like this: 

>> +++

>> title = "Template you can copy"

>> date = 2020-06-07

>> summary = "...very short summary of the item "

>> tags = ["Krause", "Advisory Panel"]

>> category = "Journal"

At the moment, we are not making any use of the tags. Later, we might want to have a way to search by tag or limit the display to items with a specific tag.
