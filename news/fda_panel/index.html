<h3 id=fda-panel-rejects-proposal-for-offering-boosters-to-everyone>FDA Panel Rejects Proposal for Offering Boosters to Everyone</h3><p>A key advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration overwhelmingly rejected recommending Pfizer booster shots for most recipients of the company’s coronavirus vaccine, instead endorsing them only for people who are 65 or older or at high risk of severe Covid-19, and received their second dose at least six months ago.</p><p>The vote — the first on boosters in the United States — was a blow to the Biden administration’s strategy to make extra shots available to most fully vaccinated adults in the United States eight months after they received a second dose. The broader rollout was to start next week.</p><p><a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/us/politics/fda-pfizer-booster-covid.html>link</a></p></div></div><div class=mt-2>
