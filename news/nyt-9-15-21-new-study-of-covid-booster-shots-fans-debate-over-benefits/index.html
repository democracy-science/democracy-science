<h1 id=new-study-of-covid-booster-shots-fans-debate-over-benefits>&ldquo;New Study of Covid Booster Shots Fans Debate Over Benefits&rdquo;</h1><p>A study conducted in Israel has sparked debates throughout the U.S government and health officials on weather a third booster is needed. Even though the FDA had not approved offering boosters to everyone, the Biden Administration pushes for a third dose, with some federal health officials agreeing while others believe it is not greatly effective. The study conducted in Israel showed that the booster was effective in slowing down infection and was beneficial for those 65 and up. However, in younger citizens, there was not sufficient evidence to prove that a third dose would prevent immunity. All the while, U.S studies and scientists say that even though a booster may not make us immune, it can help prevent infections and lower hospitalization rates.</p><p><a href=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/health/covid-booster-shot-data.html>https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/health/covid-booster-shot-data.html</a></p></div></div><div class=mt-2>
