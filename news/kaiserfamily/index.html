While a larger share of vaccinated adults say the information they have seen about boosters has been helpful (54%) than find it confusing (35%), among the unvaccinated almost twice as many find the information confusing as find it helpful (45% vs. 24%). Moreover, most unvaccinated adults see the booster discussion as a sign that the vaccines are not working as well as promised while most vaccinated adults see it as a sign that scientists are continuing to find ways to make vaccines more effective. Among fully vaccinated adults, a large majority say they would likely get a booster if the FDA and CDC recommended it for people like them, though vaccinated Republicans are somewhat less inclined than vaccinated Democrats.&rdquo;</p></div></div><div class=mt-2></div><div class="mt-4 w-md-80 border-top text-default"><div class="d-md-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class="w-md-40 pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/news/cdc_overrules_panel/>Previous</a></div></div><div class="w-md-40-max pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/news/cdceligibility/>Next</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container m-auto"><div class="d-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class=mt-4></div></div></div></body></html>
