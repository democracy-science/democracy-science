The panel felt that the effects from the first doses of the vaccine were not waning, and still provided a great deal of protection from severe illness, hospitalization, and death. Here, we can also see a push to remove politics from the discussion, saying &ldquo;with the Biden administration having already publicly backed a third dose for all vaccinated Americans in August, the committee was tasked with separating the politics from the data to weigh in on whether the benefits of a booster shot outweighed the risks to an already-hesitant American public.&rdquo;</p></div></div><div class=mt-2>
