They begin by stating that effectiveness in vaccines overtime is a common occurence and praise the COVID vaccine for its effectiveness in &ldquo;reducing risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death.&rdquo; As the Delta variant began to spread, evidence began to circulate showing the vaccine was less effective, prompting a recommendation of booster shots, particularly for at risk populations or those who were vaccinated early on. They announce that the FDA will conduct a study on the safety and effectiveness of a third dose, and that they will review the data on the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to make a recommendation later on. They finish with an emphasis on getting the vaccine in general, expressing concern over the fact that &ldquo;nearly all the cases of severe disease, hospitalization, and death continue to occur among those not yet vaccinated at all.&rdquo;</p></div></div><div class=mt-2></div><div class="mt-4 w-md-80 border-top text-default"><div class="d-md-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class="w-md-40 pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/news/pfizer-initial-data-booster/>Previous</a></div></div><div class="w-md-40-max pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/news/vaccine-equity/>Next</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container m-auto"><div class="d-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class=mt-4></div></div></div></body></html>
