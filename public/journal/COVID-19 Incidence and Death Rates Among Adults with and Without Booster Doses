"Early analysis of surveillance data provided crude signals of VE that were consistent with other studies reporting decreased VE against Omicron infection compared with Delta and increased protection from booster doses compared with a primary series of COVID-19 vaccination alone††† (10). Ongoing analyses will help monitor the impact of the Omicron variant and other emerging variants on VE against COVID-19 cases and associated deaths; rates by vaccination status will be updated monthly on CDC’s COVID Data Tracker website (3). All eligible persons should stay up to date with primary series, additional, and booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine."
