            WHO calls for halting COVID-19 vaccine boosters in favor of unvaccinated

                <p>At a time when countries deliberate the need for boosters to combat the Delta variant, the WHO called for a halt on COVID-19 vaccine boosters until at least the end of September as low-income countries struggled to administer vaccines due to lack of supply. Elin Hoffmann Dahl, infectious diseases medical adviser to Medecins Sans Frontieres&rsquo; access campaign, said that vaccinating healthy adults with a booster is a short-sighted way of thinking and if we leave the majority of the world unvaccinated as variants continue to emerge, adjusted vaccines will be needed later on. The United States in July signed a deal with Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech to buy 200 million additional doses of their COVID-19 vaccine to help with pediatric vaccination as well as possible booster shots.</p>
