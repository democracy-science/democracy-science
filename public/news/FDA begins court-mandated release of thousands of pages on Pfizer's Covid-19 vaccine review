### FDA begins court-mandated release of thousands of pages on Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine review

The sheer volume of pages and document types will give readers a good overall sense of the required documentation necessary to apply for 
a drug or vaccine approval at the FDA. But it’s still unclear if the documents will offer any new insight into the vaccine’s safety or efficacy, 
especially given the real-world data on the vaccine that’s already been published in major medical journals 
(e.g. Pfizer’s vaccine effectiveness and safety in health care personnel or Israel).
