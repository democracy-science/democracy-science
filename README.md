# This site

This site provides the content for a webpage that you can find at this URL: 

https://democracy-science-year-of-pandemic/github.io

# How the site is organized

This site currently has a very simple structure. There are pages for individual items plus a home page that displays a brief summary of each of the individual item in chronological order. (Is this the right way? Should we change it and order them the other way?)

The content is contained in the folder called "content". It has 3 subfolders for different categories of items we will track, plus a fourth for the template described below:

- Journal 
- News 
- Preprint 

Each of these three sub-folders has a item that illustrates what you can do as you record information about an item you find. As we collect information, we might add other categories of items. 

At the moment, I'm also suggesting that we add some tags that summarize what the item is about. At the moment, the site does not use the tags. We will see over time which tags might be useful and how we might use them, if we use them at all. 

# What you should do first 

Through the github interface, take a look at the item called template.md. Compare this to what you see for the corresponding item on the webpage. This will give you a sense for the formatting you can do with text in a "markdown" file. 

Next, find some item and put a new .md file under the category where it belongs. If you create a new file that follows the format of the template and refers to some new item, you will be able to see what it looks like on the webpage within a minute or so after you save it on Github.
