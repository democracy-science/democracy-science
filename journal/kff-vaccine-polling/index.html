One in five are either fully vaccinated but unlikely to get a booster (12%) or only partially vaccinated (6%), and one-quarter still have not gotten a first shot, including 14% who say they will “definitely not” get vaccinated. Three in four Democrats have already received a booster or are likely to get one compared to about half of independents and just over a third of Republicans. 76% of fully vaccinated Democrats have gotten or are likely to get booster, meanwhile this statistic is 47% in Independents and 36% in Republicans.</p><p><a href=https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/slide/politics-and-boosters/>https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/slide/politics-and-boosters/</a></p></div></div><div class=mt-2></div><div class="mt-4 w-md-80 border-top text-default"><div class="d-md-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class="w-md-40 pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/journal/booster-shot-debate/>Previous</a></div></div><div class="w-md-40-max pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/journal/new-england-journal-of-medicine-study/>Next</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container m-auto"><div class="d-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class=mt-4></div></div></div></body></html>
