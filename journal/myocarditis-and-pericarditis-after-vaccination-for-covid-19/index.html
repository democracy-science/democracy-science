Myocarditis developed rapidly in younger patients, mostly after the second vaccination. Pericarditis affected older patients later, after either the first or second dose.</p><p>Some vaccines are associated with myocarditis,5 including mRNA vaccines,1-4 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported a possible association between COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and myocarditis, primarily in younger male individuals within a few days after the second vaccination, at an incidence of about 4.8 cases per 1 million.6 This study shows a similar pattern, although at higher incidence, suggesting vaccine adverse event underreporting. Additionally, pericarditis may be more common than myocarditis among older patients.</p><p>Study limitations include cases missed in outside care settings and missed diagnoses of myocarditis or pericarditis (which would underestimate the incidence), as well as inaccurate EMR vaccination information. Temporal association does not prove causation, although the short span between vaccination and myocarditis onset and the elevated incidence of myocarditis and pericarditis in the study hospitals lend support to a possible relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782900>https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782900</a></p></div></div><div class=mt-2></div><div class="mt-4 w-md-80 border-top text-default"><div class="d-md-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class="w-md-40 pt-2"></div><div class="w-md-40-max pt-2"><div class="mb-2 text-medium"><a href=https://democracy-science.github.io/journal/cdc-ny-vaccine-effectiveness/>Next</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="container m-auto"><div class="d-flex d-flex-space-between"><div class=mt-4></div></div></div></body></html>
