<h1 id=considerations-in-boosting-covid-19-vaccine-immune-responses>Considerations in boosting COVID-19 vaccine immune responses</h1><blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;A new wave of COVID-19 cases caused by the highly transmissible delta variant is exacerbating the worldwide public health crisis, and has led to consideration of the potential need for, and optimal timing of, booster doses for vaccinated populations. Although the idea of further reducing the number of COVID-19 cases by enhancing immunity in vaccinated people is appealing, any decision to do so should be evidence-based and consider the benefits and risks for individuals and society. COVID-19 vaccines continue to be effective against severe disease, including that caused by the delta variant. Most of the observational studies on which this conclusion is based are, however, preliminary and difficult to interpret precisely due to potential confounding and selective reporting. Careful and public scrutiny of the evolving data will be needed to assure that decisions about boosting are informed by reliable science more than by politics. Even if boosting were eventually shown to decrease the medium-term risk of serious disease, current vaccine supplies could save more lives if used in previously unvaccinated populations than if used as boosters in vaccinated populations.&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p><a href=https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v3>Link to the article</a></p></div></div><div class=mt-2>
